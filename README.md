Observer Data Entry Application
===================

This application is intended for use where a web application for entry is contraindicated.
The primary situation for this is high volumes of data entry, but it could also be because
network access is restricted.  Note that the application still needs a connection to
a backend database.

The application is still very much a work in progress.
